#AI Curated Gift Recommendation Fronted App

The home page of the App contains a button, which on clicked opens a Modal consists of Form.
The user will all the neccessary details.
On Click on Submit Button, Form Validation is done.
Now after validation is done, the application will fetch Gifts Json data and render it on screen.

For integration with backend AI, we will need to make an Post API call to backend with Form data and in return gets the gift recommedation from AI. That would be render on screen.
